US news anchor Savannah Guthrie says 'we will pay' in plea for mother's return,"US news anchor Savannah Guthrie and her family have released a new video pleading for the safe return of their mother. ""We received your message, and we understand,"" Guthrie said in the video posted to Instagram on Saturday evening, flanked by her two siblings. ""We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her."" ""This is the only way we will have peace,"" she continued. ""This is very valuable to us - and we will pay."" Her video did not provide any details about the message she referenced. Nancy Guthrie disappeared in the middle of night from her home in Tucson, Arizona, last weekend. Authorities believe she was taken against her will. On Sunday, the sheriff's office said in a post on social media that no suspects, persons of interest or vehicles had been identified in the case. The FBI is offering a $50,000 (£36,000) reward for information. Nancy Guthrie was discovered missing when she did not attend a Sunday church service on 1 February and other members grew concerned. Authorities say that early on Sunday morning, a doorbell camera in her home was disconnected and removed. At about 02:28 local time, the app connected to her pacemaker, an implanted cardiac device, was disconnected from her phone. FBI Special Agent Heith Janke has said the bureau was looking into a potential ransom note sent to several media outlets. Authorities said on Friday that they were ""aware of a new message regarding Nancy Guthrie"" and were ""inspecting the information provided in the message for its authenticity"". Janke said the note ""had facts associated with a deadline with a monetary value they were asking for"", NBC News reported. A presenter for a local CBS News affiliate told the BBC that her channel had received the ""message"" but did not detail its contents. According to news website TMZ, which reportedly received one of the letters, the kidnappers were demanding millions of dollars' worth of cryptocurrency, which is popular with criminals and often difficult to trace. The family has released two previous videos saying they were willing to speak to the potential kidnapper, and asking to provide proof that her mother was alive. In a video on Thursday, Camron Guthrie - the son of the missing woman - confirmed  the family had not had any direct contact with kidnappers. ""We have to know that you have our mum,"" Camron said in the family's latest video message. ""We want to talk to you."" The FBI did arrest one individual regarding a fake ransom note on Thursday. Family, and law enforcement, have warned that Nancy Guthrie may be at risk without her medication. ""She is without any medicine,"" Savannah Guthrie said in a previous announcement. ""She needs it to survive. She needs it not to suffer."" The Pima County sheriff's office said investigators had returned to conduct ""follow-up"" at Nancy Guthrie's home on Friday as part of their investigation. They also revisited the home of Annie Guthrie, Nancy's daughter and Savannah's sister on Saturday, according to multiple US news outlets. US President Donald Trump said last week that he had spoken to Guthrie and offered federal law enforcement help. ""I think we're doing very well, meaning we have some clues, I think that are very strong and I think we could have some answers coming up fairly soon,"" he told reporters on Friday. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said on Thursday that investigators were no closer to finding out who was responsible - but that they were working on the assumption she was still alive. ""Right now, we believe Nancy is still out there. We want her home,"" he said. ""Everybody's still a suspect in our eyes."" Savannah Guthrie, 54, is a US broadcast journalist who has served as the co-anchor of NBC News' Today since 2012.  She is also the network's chief legal correspondent and a primary anchor for its election coverage. Previously, she was NBC News' White House correspondent. The disappearance of the 84-year-old mother of news anchor Savannah Guthrie has left a community searching for clues and hoping for her safe return.  It's been days since 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie disappeared in the middle of night from her home in Arizona.  Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of an NBC News presenter, is believed to have been abducted from her home in Tucson, Arizona. The BBC's Regan Morris is in Tucson, Arizona, where 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie disappeared from her home almost one week ago. Nancy Guthrie's family post their second video message this week appealing for the 84-year-old's release. Copyright 2026 BBC. All rights reserved.

Japanese stocks surge as Takaichi secures historic election victory,"Japanese stocks surged to a record high when markets opened on Monday morning, as Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) basked in a historic election victory. The LDP secured 316 out of 465 seats in Sunday's election, the first time a single party has won a two-thirds lower house majority since Japan's parliament was established in its current form in 1947. The Japan Innovation Party, the LDP's coalition partner, won in 36 more constituencies, taking their combined total to 352 seats. The resounding mandate is a gamble that paid off for Takaichi, who now faces the challenge of reviving Japan's moribund economy and tackling cost-of-living woes.  The Nikkei 225 index rallied by more than 5% in early trade on Monday, briefly crossing the 57,000 mark for the first time. The LDP's decisive win will help Takaichi advance her pro-business policies without having to negotiate extensively with opposition parties. Takaichi told reporters on Sunday that she would pursue a ""responsible yet aggressive"" fiscal policy and would not reshuffle the Cabinet, which was formed less than four months ago. Japan's first female prime minister called the snap election last month, just a few months after taking office in October. Her success is in marked contrast to her two predecessors, under whom the party lost its parliamentary majority, battled corruption scandals and struggled to curb rising costs. Markets commentators say Takaichi's policies could boost the Japanese economy.  The election outcome and upcoming moves like ""stimulus, tax tweaks, and deregulation"" will be ""additional fuel for an existing bull trend"", investment analyst Yuka Marosek told the BBC. Historically low inflation in the country has made it very sensitive to the rising cost of living over recent years. At this election, voters at polling stations told the BBC that they were worried about the increasing costs of groceries and rent. The economy is also under pressure from the country's ageing population, which has seen a shrinking workforce and ballooning social care costs. Takaichi has pledged to cut taxes and boost the Japanese economy through more spending - though where that money will come from is another big concern, given Japan's high government debt. Critics warn this could deepen instability in Japan's already fragile economy. ""We bear an extremely heavy responsibility to focus on steadily delivering on the campaign pledges we have made,"" Takaichi said on Sunday as her party's victory became clear, Kyodo reported. The LDP had lost its parliamentary majority under Takaichi's predecessor Shigeru Ishiba. And Takaichi banked on her personal appeal to turn the LDP's lost fortunes around. She has consolidated support among the LDP's conservative base by reviving long-dormant goals like revision to Japan's pacifist constitution and emphasising traditional values. But she has also connected with younger voters in a way not seen before: her handbags and pink pens have become unlikely zeitgeist items. US President Donald Trump congratulated Takaichi on her victory, writing on Truth Social that it was an ""Honor"" to endorse her ahead of the election. ""The wonderful people of Japan, who voted with such enthusiasm, will always have my strong support,"" Trump said. Just one week after Takaichi took office in October last year, Tokyo rolled out the red carpet for Trump when he visited Japan. It was her diplomatic debut, and the optics were striking: fists pumping as the US president praised her in front of thousands of US soldiers. Takaichi is due to travel to Washington in March for a second meeting with Trump.  Additional reporting by Peter Hoskins and Adam Hancock Her ruling coalition is set to clinch a decisive win, taking two-thirds of the seats in the House of Representatives. Sanae Takaichi is popular - but inflation and a diplomatic row with China weigh on voters' minds.  It is rare for US presidents to publicly back candidates in foreign elections.  ""Overtourism"" during Japan's iconic blossom season makes life for locals in Fujiyoshida town unmanageable, authorities say.

"Andrew shared confidential information with Epstein as trade envoy, files suggest","Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor appears to have knowingly shared confidential information with Jeffrey Epstein from his official work as trade envoy in 2010 and 2011, according to material in the latest release of files in the US seen by the BBC. Emails from the recently-released batch of Epstein files show the former prince passing on reports of visits to Singapore, Hong Kong and Vietnam and confidential details of investment opportunities. Under official guidance, trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality over sensitive, commercial, or political information about their official visits. The former Duke of York, who served as trade envoy between 2001 and 2011, has been contacted for comment but is yet to respond. Andrew has consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing. Being named in the Epstein files is not an indication of misconduct. The emails indicate that on 7 October 2010, Andrew sent Epstein details of his official upcoming trips as trade envoy to Singapore, Vietnam, Shenzhen in China and Hong Kong, where he was accompanied by business associates of Epstein. After the trip, on 30 November, he appears to have forwarded official reports of those visits sent by his then-special assistant, Amit Patel, to Epstein, five minutes after receiving them.  Andrew told BBC Newsnight in 2019 that he last saw Epstein in New York in early December 2010 to tell the disgraced financier he was breaking off the friendship. However, on Christmas Eve that year, he emailed Epstein a confidential briefing on investment opportunities in the reconstruction of Helmand Province, Afghanistan, which was overseen at the time by British armed forces and funded by UK government money. By this time, Epstein was already a convicted sex offender. Sir Vince Cable, who was then business secretary, said: ""I was unaware of Andrew... sharing information about investment opportunities [in Afghanistan] before, this is the first I've heard of it."" In a further email dated 9 February 2011, Andrew suggests Epstein might invest in a private equity firm he visited a week before. Official terms of reference for trade envoys state that they ""are not civil servants"", adding: ""However, the role of a Trade Envoy carries with it a duty of confidentiality in relation to information received. This may include sensitive, commercial, or political information shared about relevant markets/visits. ""This duty of confidentiality will continue to apply after the expiry of their term of office. In addition, the Official Secrets Acts 1911 and 1989 will apply."" Andrew has faced years of scrutiny over his past friendship with Epstein. He was stripped of his royal titles in October last year following increasing numbers of questions about his links to the late, convicted sex offender. Earlier in February, Andrew moved out of his home in Windsor to the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk. Buckingham Palace had announced in October that he would be moving from Royal Lodge, at the same time his title of prince was removed. The former prince left the property on Monday night and is currently living at Wood Farm on the Sandringham Estate while his new permanent home undergoes renovations. The former Labour MP says evidence was disregarded in the decision to make Mandelson ambassador to the US. No 10 sources have called for Mandelson to return the money or give it to a charity that supports victims.  Millions of Epstein-related documents released by the US justice department include the names of the world's rich and powerful.

PM's chief aide McSweeney quits over Mandelson row,"Morgan McSweeney has dramatically quit as Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff, after mounting scrutiny over his role in Lord Mandelson's appointment as the UK's ambassador to the US. The PM's adviser had been coming under pressure after pushing for the former minister to be given the job, despite the peer's relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein being publicly known about at the time. McSweeney said he did not oversee the vetting but wanted to take ""full responsibility"" for advising the prime minister to appoint him. It leaves Sir Keir battling to shore up his premiership as he continues to face anger from Labour MPs over his decision to hire the peer for the Washington role. Sir Keir sacked Lord Mandelson in September, after emails emerged showing he sent supportive messages to Epstein as he faced charges for sex offences. But further revelations this week from the latest release of Epstein files in the US about his continued contact with the late disgraced financier after his conviction in 2008 have led to fresh fury within Labour over the decision to hand him the role. Emails suggesting the peer leaked sensitive government information to Epstein whilst a minister in the last Labour government have also prompted a police investigation into alleged misconduct in public office. Sir Keir has said Lord Mandelson's prior relationship was Epstein was flagged when he was vetted for the role, whilst insisting the former cabinet minister misled him about the depth of the relationship. But it has failed to contain the row over the decision, with a handful of Labour MPs now openly calling for Sir Keir to resign as party leader. York Central MP Rachael Maskell told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour that the prime minister has a ""very tight timetable... to prove that he has got it in him to lead us forward"". Alloa and Grangemouth MP Brian Leishman called on Sir Keir to ""look at his own position"" and question whether he should ""resign for the good of the country and the Labour Party"". But others have thrown their support behind him. Karl Turner, Kingston upon Hull East MP, told BBC Radio 5 Live Sir Keir knew it was ""a catastrophic mistake"" to appoint Lord Mandelson and ""he wants to make good"".  Rugby's MP John Slinger called for his party to ""rally behind the prime minister"", adding: ""We don't ditch a leader just because the going gets tough."" Sir Keir will address Labour MPs in private on Monday evening, at the weekly Parliamentary Labour Party meeting, as he seeks to convince his backbenchers he can regain control. It was earlier suggested that he might publicly address the episode on Monday but this is not thought to be the case at this stage. It comes as the boss of the Fire Brigades Union, Steve Wright, became the first leader of one of Labour's 11 affiliated unions to call for the prime minister to go. McSweeney's departure is a big blow to Sir Keir, with the 48-year-old Irishman having masterminded his successful bid for the Labour leadership in 2020 and the party's campaign for the general election in 2024. His deputies Jill Cuthbertson and Vidhya Alakeson have been appointed acting chiefs of staff in the wake of his exit, Downing Street has confirmed. In a statement on Sunday, McSweeney said Lord Mandelson's appointment in December 2024 had been ""wrong"", adding he had ""damaged our party, our country and trust in politics itself."" ""When asked, I advised the prime minister to make that appointment and I take full responsibility for that advice,"" he added. ""While I did not oversee the due diligence and vetting process, I believe that process must now be fundamentally overhauled. ""In the circumstances, the only honourable course is to step aside."" It is understood that both the prime minister and McSweeney decided now was the right moment for him to leave.  Sir Keir said it had been an ""honour"" to work with him, thanking him for ""turning our party around"" in the wake of its crushing defeat in the 2019 election.  Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said it was ""about time"" McSweeney resigned, but added the prime minister ""has to take responsibility for his own terrible decisions"".  The Lib Dems said Sir Keir ""can change his advisers all he likes, but the buck stops with him"", while Reform said Labour was ""just continuing the chaos we saw under the Tories"". The statement from McSweeney came just hours after a key Starmer ally had dismissed calls from within Labour for Sir Keir to sack his adviser. Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden told Laura Kuenssberg it would not make ""any difference at all"" to the situation facing the government. He also called on Lord Mandelson to return or donate to charity the pay-off he received after his sacking as ambassador, thought to be up to £40,000. The BBC understands Lord Mandelson's view is he answered questions about his relationship with Epstein in the vetting process accurately. Email exchanges in the latest US government release on Epstein include several from Lord Mandelson during his time as a cabinet minister in the Labour government of Gordon Brown. Among them is one that indicates Lord Mandelson gave Epstein advance notice of a €500bn bailout by the EU to save the Euro in 2010. Another suggests he forwarded the financier an internal No 10 memo in 2009 discussing potential government asset sales in the wake of the financial crash. Lord Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment but the BBC understands his position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.  He has resigned as a member of the House of Lords, with the government pledging to introduce legislation required to strip him of his title.  Copyright 2026 BBC. All rights reserved.

"In the AI gold rush, tech firms are embracing 72-hour weeks","The recruitment website is jazzy, awash with pictures of happy young workers, and festooned with upbeat mini-slogans such as ""insane speed"", ""infinite curiosity"" and ""customer obsession"". Read a bit lower, and there are promises of perks galore: competitive compensation, free meals, free gym membership, free health and dental care and so on. But then comes the catch. Each job ad contains a warning: ""Please don't join if you're not excited about… working ~70 hrs/week in person with some of the most ambitious people in NYC."" The website belongs to Rilla, a New York-based tech business which sells AI-based systems that allow employers to monitor sales representatives when they are out and about, interacting with clients. The company has become something of a poster child for a fast-paced workplace culture known as 996, also sometimes referred to as hustle culture or grindcore. In simple terms, it puts a premium on long working hours, typically 9am to 9pm, six days a week (hence ""996""). For most of us, that would be gruelling. But according to Will Gao, head of growth at Rilla, its 120 employees simply don't see it that way. ""We look for people who are like Olympian athletes, with characteristics of, you know, obsession, infinite ambition. ""It's people who want to do incredible things and have a lot of fun while doing so,"" he says. He insists that while the hours are generally long, there's no rigid structure.  ""If I'm like, 'Holy cow, I have a super idea I'm working on', then I'll just keep working until 2 or 3am, then I'll just roll in the next day at noon or something"", he explains. This kind of approach has become extremely popular in the technology sector over the past few years, and for good reason. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) has been taking place at a breakneck pace, and companies around the world are now working flat-out to develop ways in which it can be exploited and monetised. Huge amounts of money are being ploughed into AI ventures, many of them start-ups. But for every ambitious company founder, the ever-present fear is that someone else will get there first. Speed is of the essence – and tech sector workers are under pressure to work harder, and longer, to get results quickly. The 996 culture first came to the fore in China a decade ago. It was embraced by tech companies and start-ups at a time when the country was increasingly focused on transforming itself from the world's workshop for cheap goods into a leader in advanced technologies. It had some powerful advocates. They included Jack Ma, the billionaire founder of the retail behemoth Alibaba.com. ""I personally think that being able to work 996 is a huge blessing"", he wrote in one blog post for employees. ""It's not just entrepreneurs; most successful or ambitious artists, scientists, athletes, officials, and politicians work 996 or more"", he said in another.  ""It's not because they have extraordinary perseverance, but because they are deeply passionate about their chosen careers"", he added. Another enthusiast was Richard Liu, founder of the retail behemoth JD.com, who at one point railed against what he saw as the country's declining work ethic.  ""Slackers are not my brothers!"", he wrote in a controversial email to staff in 2019. But such an attitude prompted a backlash, including a wave of online complaints that companies were ignoring labour laws and failing to pay overtime, while forcing employees to work excessive hours. By 2021 this chorus of disapproval had become too loud for the authorities to ignore – and prompted a legal crackdown. In China, 996 has not disappeared, but its advocates have generally been a lot quieter. A notable exception was Baidu's one-time head of public relations, Qu Jing, who posted a series of videos on social media in 2024, aggressively defending a hard-working culture. Her brusque dismissal of employees' wellbeing, with the comment ""I'm not your mother, I only care about results"" provoked outrage. She later apologised, but it ultimately cost Qu her job. Yet the culture still has fans elsewhere.  Last year, Narayana Murthy, the founder of Indian software giant Infosys, spoke admiringly about China's use of 996. He remarked in a TV interview that ""no individual, no community, no country has ever come up without hard work"". So why has the US tech industry chosen to embrace the trend? A key factor appears to have been the headlong rush to develop ways of using AI. ""It's mainly AI companies,"" explains Adrian Kinnersley, who runs recruitment businesses in Europe and North America. ""It's those that have some funding from venture capitalists, that are in a race to develop their products and get them out to market before someone else beats them to it. That's led them into the idea that, if you work longer hours, you win the race."" One of those AI start-ups is run by Magnus Müller, a young German-born entrepreneur. He co-founded Browser-Use, a business that is developing tools to help AI applications interact with web browsers. He lives in a ""hacker-house"", a shared living and workspace, where he and his colleagues continually swap ideas, and believes working long hours is just a fact of life. ""I think it's hard, what we're trying to build. I think it's the problems we're trying to solve, giving AI these extra capabilities. It's super hard, and very competitive, and most often the returns come when you just immerse yourself very deeply into a problem… then suddenly fascinating things happen."" Browser-Use currently has just seven staff, but it is recruiting more. Müller says he is looking for people with the same kind of mentality as himself. Anyone who wants to work a 40-hour week, he says, is unlikely to fit in. ""We really look for people who are just addicted, who love what they're doing"", he emphasises. ""It's like gaming, OK? It's like you're addicted to gaming… for us, it doesn't really feel like work. We just do what we love."" Others disagree. Deedy Das is a partner at Menlo Ventures, a venture capital firm which has a near 50-year record of investing in technology businesses. He thinks the most common mistake young entrepreneurs make is insisting their employees work 996-style hours. ""I think the thing young founders get wrong is they view hours worked in and of itself as necessary and sufficient to think of themselves as productive. And that's where the fallacy lies"", he explains.  ""Forcing your employees to come in, and hustle, is a downstream artefact of such a mindset."" He thinks such an approach can alienate those with families, as well as experienced older workers who ""can actually work far less and achieve much more because they know what they're doing"". He adds that continual long hours will lead to long-term burnout. However, he concedes that for company founders themselves, with skin in the game and the potential to become very wealthy if their business succeeds, different rules apply. ""Frankly, I would be shocked if a founder wasn't working 70-80 hours per week. I can personally say… if I'm investing in an early-stage founder, if they're not working 70-80 hours a week, it's probably not a great investment."" Academic and author on workplace culture, Tamara Myles, says hustle culture is unsustainable, especially if people feel compelled to be working at all times. But she concedes there are grey areas. ""The nuance here is that a lot of these tech companies that are living this 996 culture are actually not hiding it, they're advertising it. They're selling it as a badge of honour, almost,"" she says. But that doesn't mean everyone who agrees to work 996 actually wants to, she argues. ""You might be staying because the job market is tough right now, or you might be here for a visa, and you depend on it. So there might be power dynamics at play."" Yet those who do choose to burn the midnight oil could end up paying a heavy price. Concerns over the health impact of working long hours are certainly not new. In Japan, a country with a long-established hard-work culture, where so-called salarymen have notoriously supported the post-war economy with utter dedication to their employers, there is even a word for it: Karōshi. It means death through overwork, and refers principally to strokes and heart attacks suffered by people working very long hours. Karōjisatsu, meanwhile, refers to people taking or attempting to take their own lives due to workplace stress. Both are recognised in Japanese law, and families are in theory eligible for compensation from a government scheme, although in practice proving a death derives from overwork can be difficult. More broadly, analysis published in 2021 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) concluded that long working hours - defined as more than 55 hours per week - had led to 745,000 deaths worldwide from stroke and heart disease in 2016. It concluded that working 55 hours or more a week increased the risk of dying of heart disease by 17% compared to working 35-40 hours, and raised the risk of a stroke by 35%. Then, there's productivity - broadly speaking the amount that actually gets done for every hour worked.  Studies have shown that as hours go up, productivity initially increases - but once a threshold is reached it starts to decline again as physical and mental exhaustion sets in. The 'sweet spot' is widely recognised to be around 40 hours per week. As one recent study put it: ""At around 40h per five-day work week, workers seem to be able to maintain productivity fairly well, but when individuals exceed this threshold and engage in longer work hours, their job performance gradually weakens because of increased fatigue and underprivileged health conditions."" In other words, once this threshold is reached, the extra output from every hour worked starts to decline.  Even so, there will always be a temptation for companies to employ fewer people and get them to work for longer. This is because each extra employee comes at a cost: they have to be recruited, trained if necessary, and paid. But research suggests this approach can backfire. According to Michigan State University, productivity can fall so sharply that ""an employee working 70 hours per week has almost no difference in output than an employee working 50 hours per week"". This isn't a new concept. A century ago, Henry Ford set an example that other major industrialists would follow, when he cut working hours for staff in his car factories and adopted a 40-hour, five-day week. Nevertheless, there are those who believe that British companies today could take a leaf out of the US tech sector's book. For example, the co-founder and former CEO of BrewDog, James Watt, posted a widely-shared video in which he said: ""I think the whole concept of work-life balance was invented by people who hate the work they do. So if you love what you do, you don't need work life balance, you need work-life integration."" He subsequently pointed to a study by academics at King's College London that showed people in the UK are among the least likely to believe work should always come first. He said it showed the UK to be ""one of the world's least work-oriented countries"". In a BBC documentary in 2022, Watt himself was accused of inappropriate behaviour and abuse of power in the workplace. He apologised to anyone who felt uncomfortable because of his behaviour but hit out at ""false rumours and misinformation"".  BrewDog's new chief executive James Taylor said last year the business is  ""well past"" its previous controversies. For some in the UK, talk of 996 culture could feel rather familiar.  Jobs at large corporate law firms here pay high salaries, but many demand long hours in return. According to a survey carried out last year by the website Legal Cheek, it is not uncommon for average working days to be 12 hours or more. Investment banking - the wheeling and dealing side of the financial industry, which looks after mergers, acquisitions and stock market launches - is also notorious for long hours. Industry sources suggest 65 to 70 hours a week are relatively common, and can extend up to 100 hours when a major deal is being finalised. Is it legal here? UK law, under the working time regulations, states that most employees should not have to work more than 48 hours a week on average. But people can choose to opt out and work longer if they choose. So provided the employee gives their consent, 996 is allowed. However Ben Wilmott, head of public policy at the human resources professionals' association CIPD, thinks it is wrong to believe that long hours lead to better performance. ""There doesn't seem to be any correlation at all between working long hours and productivity"", he says. ""There is quite good evidence which shows there's a risk of ill health if you work long hours… there's a higher risk of stroke and heart disease. ""So I think the focus should be on working smarter rather than longer… improving management capability, technology adoption, adoption of AI to improve productivity, rather than a focus on increasing working hours."" Some campaigners believe the UK could actually benefit from a reduction in working hours, and the adoption of a four-day week. They point to the results of a pilot project carried out in 2022, in which 61 organisations agreed to cut working hours for all staff for six months without any reduction in pay. It concluded that this significantly reduced stress and illness in the workforce, and helped companies retain staff, without losing productivity. Recruitment expert Adrian Kinnersley believes the current enthusiasm for 996 remains largely confined to the technology sector, and for a good reason. ""Whether you need to work 80 hours a week is debatable, but I think you would struggle in the current environment to compete with a relaxed 35-hour week culture,"" he says. For Browser-Use founder Magnus Müller meanwhile, the hours he and his peers work in Silicon Valley are really nothing remarkable. ""I'm from a tiny village in south Germany"", he says. ""The farmers there, they get up at five every day and work more than 12 hours per day, seven days a week. And they don't take any holidays, or maybe just two to three days when they can get someone to take care of their cows. ""So I think there are so many industries where people have so much harder jobs, and struggle so much harder, and work so much harder. I would say it's more like kindergarten, what we are doing compared to them."" Top image credit: Getty.

France murder trial complicated by twin brothers with same DNA,"Two identical twins on trial for murder in France have confounded attempts to determine which one pulled the trigger because they have the same DNA, French media report. The 33-year-old brothers are among five defendants on trial near Paris, accused of a double murder and several subsequent attempted killings in 2020, according to reputable French newspaper Le Parisien. It reports that both are suspected of conspiring to plot the double murder, but that DNA on an assault rifle used in one of the later gun battles could only be from one twin. A police officer told the court that forensic experts were unable to tell which of the brothers had been conclusively implicated. ""Only their mother can tell them apart,"" one investigator is quoted as telling the court in Bobigny, north of the French capital. There is reportedly a tense atmosphere in the court where the trial is taking place. On Tuesday, both twins were said to have been expelled from the courtroom for refusing to stand up. Police believe they have taken advantage of their resemblance to cover their tracks. A senior officer quoted by Le Parisien said the pair frequently exchanged clothes, phones and identification documents. Identical twins develop from a single fertilised egg that splits during pregnancy. Because they originate from the same egg and sperm, they share exactly the same DNA, making forensic identification extremely difficult. With genetic data unable to distinguish between them, investigators relied on phone records, surveillance footage, wiretaps and efforts to corroborate their whereabouts and movements, according to Le Parisien. But the crucial question of who fired the recovered weapon remains an open one.  The trial continues, with court due to reach a decision in late February.
